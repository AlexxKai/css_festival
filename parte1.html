        <p>Here is also a very useful recipe for the first days of the festival.</p>

                <p id="ing">POTATO OMELETTE RECIPE</p>
                <p>Ingredients (4 persons)</p>
                <li>5 eggs</li>
                <li>500 g potatoes</li>
                <li>1 onion</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <ol>
                    <p id="text">CUT AND FRY THE POTATOES AND ONION.</p>
                    <li>Peel and wash the potatoes and cut them and the onion into thin slices.</li>
                    <li>Put both in a frying pan and cover with extra virgin olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Cook over a medium-low heat until they begin to brown. You will know the potatoes are done when they start to break, with the paddle. For the omelette to be juicy, it is important that the potatoes are well done and confit, because there is nothing worse than an omelette with half-raw potatoes. So be patient with this step.</li>
                    <p id="text">MIX WITH THE EGGS</p>
                    <li>Remove from the frying pan and drain well. Put in a large bowl</li>
                    <li>Beat the eggs and add them to the potatoes and onion, add a little salt and mix.</li>
                    <li>Leave for a couple of minutes to mix well.</li>
                    <li>Some people prefer to leave the potatoes whole and others prefer to mash them a little with the paddle so that they mix well with the egg.</li>
                    <p id="text">WE COOK THE OMELETTE</p>
                    <li>Put a couple of spoonfuls of extra virgin olive oil in the frying pan and pour everything in.</li>
                    <li>At first we break it up a little, as if we were going to make a stir fry, then we shape it around the edges.</li>
                    <p id="text">WE TURN THE POTATO OMELETTE OVER.</p>
                    <li>When we see that the bottom is set, we put a plate or a lid on top of the frying pan and quickly turn it over.</li>
                    <li>Put the frying pan back on the heat and slide the omelette from the plate back into the frying pan.</li>
                    <li>Leave for a few more minutes while rounding the edges with the spatula (2 or 3 if you like it more curdled, less if you like it juicy) to finish cooking and our <b>potato omelette</b> is ready.</li>
                </ol>
